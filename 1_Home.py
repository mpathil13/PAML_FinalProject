st.markdown('<div style="text-align: justify;">T cell activation is triggered by the binding of T cell \
    receptors (TCR) to peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. \
    Due to the critical role T cells play in recognizing and responding to infection, significant efforts \
    have been made to understand and predict TCR specificity for peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes. This project \
    aims to utilize structure-based metrics of pMHC-TCR complexes to accurately predict MHC presentation \
    and TCR recognition. We will train models using na√Øve Bayes classification and support vector \
    machines and evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. By including \
    structural information in model training, we expect strong performance with MHC presentation and \
    improved performance for TCR recognition compared to existing sequence-based models. Regarding \
    impact, our project will provide insight into the effectiveness of structure-based features for \
    predicting TCR specificity.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
